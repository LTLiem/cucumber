  Scenario: Reconcile DYN_TP_FX_OUT
    Given I have two CSV files as below
    	| Data Name  | File path                    |
    	| MxG2K_R310 | test-data/R310/FX_OUT_THB_MX2.csv|
    	| MX.3_R310  | test-data/R310/FX_OUT_THB_MX3.csv|
      And The data structure of these data is at "test-data/R310/FX_OUT_THB_Metadata.csv"
     When I compare these data with difference result is generated at "test-result/R310/" with prefix name "R310_TP_FX_OUTMTM_" 
     Then The different result should be empty

    	| MxG2K_R310 | M_NB |test-data/R310/R310_MX2.csv |
    	| MX.3_R310  | M_NB |test-data/R310/R310_MX3.csv|
     When I compare these "CSV" data with difference result is generated at "test-result/R310/" with prefix name "R310_CSV_DM_" 
     Then The different result should be empty

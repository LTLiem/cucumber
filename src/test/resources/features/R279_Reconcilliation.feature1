Feature: Demo Reconciliation
  @R279
  Scenario: Reconcile DYN_TP_FX_OUT
    Given I have two CSV files as below
    	| Data Name  | File path                    |
    	| MxG2K_R279 | test-data/R279/TP_TMB_FX_TRAN_MX2.csv|
    	| MX.3_R279  | test-data/R279/TP_TMB_FX_TRAN_MX3.csv|
      And The data structure of these data is at "test-data/R279/TP_TMB_FX_TRAN_Metadata.csv"
     When I compare these data with difference result is generated at "test-result/R279/" with prefix name "R279_TP_FX_TRAN_" 
     Then The different result should be empty

  Scenario: Reconcile CSV files from two datasources driven by header row
    Given I have two CSV files separated by ";" as below
    	| Data Name  | Key Columns             | File path                            |
    	| MxG2K_R279 | M_NB,M_QTY_INDEX |test-data/R279/R279_2.csv |
    	| MX.3_R279  | M_CONTRACT,M_QTY_INDEX |test-data/R279/R279_3.csv |
     When I compare these "CSV" data with difference result is generated at "test-result/R279/" with prefix name "R279_CSV_" 
     Then The different result should be empty
